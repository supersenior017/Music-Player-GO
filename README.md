# Features:

### Unifield UI, the way I'd like it to be:

- Colorful, simple and 'unified' UI: no need to navigate between screens;
- Awesome typeface: Raleway + Roboto condensed
- Expandable bottom panel containing the player controls and the settings (if expanded):
  - Played song info: clicking on it You can open the played Artist's page/album or open/close the Artist's page You're exploring (when not playing). The text is scrollable on long click;
  - Skip to previous song (long click to enable reset 1x);
  - Play/pause;
  - Skip to next song;
- Music organized by Artist (the Artists names are scrollable on long click);
- 'Revealable' Artist's page: albums + songs (the selected album title and songs titles are scrollable on long click);
- Colorful alphabetic scrollbar;
- Dark status bar icons (available from Android Marshmallow);

### Settings at hand: 

- Dynamic shuffle button: randomly plays the device or the Artist songs (when the Artist's page is 'revealed');
- System equalizer (if present on the device);
- Themes (light and inverted)
- Link to git page;
- 16 awesome UI accents!;


### Other features: 

- Pause/resume when the headsets are (dis)connected;
- Simple audio focus (notifications, calls, or other media apps) management;


### Minimal code:

*Based on nothing: it was written from scratch besides few snippets here and there*

### For developers:
Want to help, but You **get stuck** during the build process at **'Configuration on demand is not supported by the current version'** on Android Studio 3.x.x?


Here is the fix: https://stackoverflow.com/a/49996317

### What does this cost?
*Music Player GO will always be free! Anyway, you can still buy me a beer, an ice cream or something via [PayPal](https://www.paypal.me/enricocid) if You really liked it! :)*

### Dependencies/API used: 

  - Android Support Design (Material Design Components)
  - Android Support Library v4 core-utils;
  - Android Support Library v4 media-compat;
