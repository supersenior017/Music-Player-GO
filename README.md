# Features:

### Unifield UI, the way I'd like it to be:

- Colorful and simple UI;
- Unified UI: no need to navigate between activities;
- Music organized by artist;
- Fast scrolling;
- Sliding up panel containing controls (when collapsed) and the artist albums/songs (when expanded);
- Dark status bar icons for light accents
- Horizontally slide too long played song/album text in controls panel (long click on it);
- Play All! button to play all songs in device;
- Ability to play all the songs from an artist;

### Open settings directly from UI. Available settings: 

- Themes (light and inverted)
- Link to git page;
- 17 UI accents!;
- Equalizer;
- Toggle Play All! button visibility;

### Minimal code:

*Based on nothing: it was written from scratch besides few snippets here and there*

### What does this cost?
*Music Player GO will always be free! Anyway, you can still buy me a beer, an ice cream or something via [PayPal](https://www.paypal.me/enricocid) if You really liked it! :)*
