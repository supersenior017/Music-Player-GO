### Very simple and nice UI "Everything in one UI", the way I'd like it to be:

- Music organized by artist;
- Fast scroller;
- Sliding up panel containing controls (when collapsed) and the artist albums/songs (when expanded);
- Dark status bar icons for light accents
(according to https://material.io/guidelines/style/color.html#color-color-palette);
- No need to navigate between activities;

### Open settings directly from UI. Available settings: 

- Equalizer;
- Immersive Mode;
- UI inversion;
- UI accents;

### Minimal code:

- Based on nothing: it was written from scratch besides few snippets here and there;
- Dependencies used: 

  - Sliding up panel by @umano (https://github.com/umano/AndroidSlidingUpPanel);
  - Android Support Library v4;
  - RecyclerView-FastScroll by @timusus (https://github.com/timusus/RecyclerView-FastScroll);

### Other features: 

- Pause/resume when the headsets are (dis)connected;
- Simple audio focus (notifications, calls, or other media apps) management;
